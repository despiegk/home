### New decentralized internet
### Blokchain-powered cloud computing

[Peer2peer.io](http://peer2peer.io)

## Perface:
Today most of the computing power controlled by several corporations and couple of governments. This creates field for abuse.
We belive that internet should be decentralized. Complexity of IT systems is growing every year and it becomes more and more expensive to operate IT systems. We belive it should be possible to use it as easy as we use electricity today. We call this "IT as Energy" concept. 
What does it mean:
- Available on demand on whatever capacity needed. 
- Billed according to useage.
- Unified and simple interface for multiple use-cases. 

## Concept

Peer2peer.io is a blockchain-controlled, decentralized cloud computing engine. 
Initial implementation is based on sia.tech blockchain and openvcloud cloud platform.

#### Why it should be interesting for both capacity providers and capacity consumers?
For capacity consumers:
- More fair pricing comared to traditional cloud services due to built-in marketplace.
- No depandancy on signle provider or single government (no locks, bans, information leaks, etc)
- Increased privacy due to payload distributed across multiple providers.
- Auditable security and privacy standards due to open-source stack. 
- Appealing performance of [GIG](https://www.greenitglobe.com/) cloud technology.
- Single point of access to multiple capaity providers.

For capacity providers:
- Market opportunity for micro, small and medium size cloud providers to jump into the market. 
- No need of custom infrastructure: ready-made technology stack.
- Transparent billing and accounting system.
