### New decentralized internet
### Blokchain-powered cloud computing

[Peer2peer.io](http://peer2peer.io)

## Perface:
Today most of the computing power controlled by several corporations and couple of governments. This creates field for abuse.
We belive that internet should be decentralized. Complexity of IT systems is growing every year and it becomes more and more expensive to operate IT systems. We belive it should be possible to use it as easy as we use electricity today. We call this "IT as Energy" concept. 
What does it mean:
- Available on demand on whatever capacity needed. 
- Billed according to useage.
- Unified and simple interface for multiple use-cases. 

## Concept

Peer2peer.io is a blockchain-controlled, decentralized cloud computing engine. 
Initial implementation is based on sia.tech blockchain and openvcloud cloud platform.

#### Why it should be interesting for both capacity providers and capacity consumers?
For capacity consumers:
- More fair pricing comared to traditional cloud services due to built-in marketplace.
- No depandancy on signle provider or single government (no locks, bans, information leaks, etc)
- Increased privacy due to payload distributed across multiple providers.
- Auditable security and privacy standards due to open-source stack. 
- Enterprise-level feature set and appealing performance of [GIG](https://www.greenitglobe.com/) cloud technology.
- Single point of access to multiple capacity providers.

For capacity providers:
- Cloud market is making ~40% CAGR. 89% controlled by big corporations in US (Goolge, Amazon, etc). Right now there is almost no possibility of competition for small providers. Peer2peer.io creates a marketplaces and gives market opportunity for micro, small and medium size cloud providers. 
- No need of custom infrastructure: ready-made technology stack.
- Transparent billing and accounting system.
- Lowest possible cost of ownership.

#### Feature Roadmap

##### Stage 1: PoC
Make openvcloud instance discovery though sia blockchain: replace sia's storage announce with the simplest possible form of integration with openvcloud instance. 

##### Stage 2: MVP
1. Launch payment token and billing system.
2. Allow different istances
3. Add baisc identity management: private-public key identites.

##### Stage 3: Full featureset of openvcloud
Full featureset of openvcloud available and billable

##### Stage 4: Advanced identity management on blockchain (itsyou.online)
Integrate with ityou.online identity management platform and implemnet groups, ACLs

##### Stage 5: Encrypted blockchain storage stack
Replace existing storage layer tied to specific node to blockchain-controlled storage layer.
