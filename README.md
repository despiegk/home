### New decentralized internet
### Blokchain-powered cloud computing

[Peer2peer.io](http://peer2peer.io)

Peer2peer.io is a blockchain-controlled, decentralized cloud computing engine. 
Initial implementation is based on sia.tech blockchain and openvcloud cloud platform. 

## Perface:
Today most of the computing power controlled by several corporations and couple of governments. This creates field for abuse.
We belive that internet should be decentralized.
